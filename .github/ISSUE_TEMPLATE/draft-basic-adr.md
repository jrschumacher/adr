<!--
  Welcome 👋 if this is your first time writing an ADR, please take the time
  to read this, otherwise jump right in.

  An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a
  functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.
  Do not take the term “architecture” too seriously or interpret it too strongly,
  instead, consider AD as Any Decision.

  The focus is capturing decisions, so it should be as easy as possible to
   a) write down the decisions and b) to version the decisions.

# ADR_TITILE_SUMMARY

## Context and Problem Statement
<!--
  Describe the context and problem statement. E.g.

  Decisions are being made and some are captured while others are not.
  Additionally, the decisions are captured in too many places. What process
  should we use and where should we capture them?
-->

## Considered Options
<!--
  List all considered options. E.g.

  * Confluence, use the DACI template
  * Google Docs, develop a template
  * Hashicorp Hermes, use the existing templates
  * Github, use the MADR template
-->

## Decision Outcome
<!--
  Select the option that you chose to use and include an optional description.

  E.g. 
  Chosen option: "Github" because it keeps our decisions close to the code
  while the MADR template focuses on making it easy to capture decisions
  and version them.

Chosen option: ""
